General architecture:
    1. Bid on campaigns based on some policy made by us
    2. Use model that takes vector of size (~24) and outputs size (~20+20)

Campaign: (segment, reach, budget, start, end)
reach = budget for "free" campaigns
statistics = {campaign #, (num impressions, dollars spent)}

Level 1 TA bots bid 0.999 on just their segment
    - we can beat this by bidding 0.9 on just our segment (no campaign bidding)

Effective reach
    - ER = sigmoidal in [0, 1.38442]
    - profit = ER * Budget - Cost

Quality Score:
    - QS_t+1 = (QS_t + ER) / 2
    - affects campaign bidding

Part 1: Bidding on Campaigns
##################################

Lowest bidder wins and gets the campaign with
budget equal to the second highest bid. 

So, we want to bid what we think the campaign 
is worth. Not sure how to figure this out?
What's considered a good campaign vs bad?

Input - vector of size (26) comprised of the following:
    - 20 segments, represented as one-hot
    - reach (0, 1], get this by normalizing by 3067
    - budget (0, 1], get this by normalizing by ??
    - days left in campaign (0, 1], get this by normalizing by 10
    - current day, one hot

Output - vector of size (20):
    - the bids [0, 1] for each of the 20 segments
    - limits

Loss Function
    - profit
